        The series is loosely based on The 100, the first novel in the hundred
        series by Kass Morgan. Some characters are original characters and do
        not appear in the books. A few also have their personalities switched or
        shared. The TV series is also considered to be ahead of the book series
        in events. Many of the events that happen in the TV show may not happen
        in the books.
